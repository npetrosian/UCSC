What were the learning objectives of this lab?
We were asked to simualate a guessing game. For successful completion of the game,
we had to master the following concepts:
1. Creating logic circuits for comparators 
2. Creating a logic circuit for an encoder, which converts the output from the comparators
   to generate a number to be added to the score.  
3. Creating a logic circuit for adders, which adds two four-bit binaries to each other, and
   generates the sum. 
4. Creating a register using four D flip-flops, which keeps the running score. 
5. Creating a circuit which generates the 2SC of a four-bit binary value. 
6. Creating a multiplexor for the 2SC circuit explained in #5, above. 
7. Creating a cheat circuit for the extra credit. 

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable? 
I encountered many issues, but I was able to resolve them with the help of lab TA's and 
tutors, reviewing lecture videos, and the online resources that are cited in the code. 
Overall, it was an enjoyable project but I was nervous if I would ever finish it on time. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I think the design of this lab was very creative, and I can't think of a way to improve it.
