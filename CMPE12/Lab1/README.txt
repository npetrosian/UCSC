CMPE 012 Fall 2018

Petrosian, Natalie

-------------------------

What did you learn in this lab?
1. How to work with MMLogic
2. How to create a logic circuit in MMLogic based on truth tables (SOP)
3. How to convert an existing circuit to a NAND's only circuit
4. How to convert an existing circuit to a NOR's only circuit

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
Getting MMLogic to work on a Mac was a little challenging but we had good instructions. 
I had to use Google to find MMLogic tutorials to get an early start. 
This was a challenging lab, but I learned a lot. 
I did not encounter any insurmountable issues. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
This lab is a great introduction to circuit design using MMLogic, 
and I can't think of a way to make it better than it already is.
