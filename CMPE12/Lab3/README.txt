CMPE 12 Fall 2018

-----------------------
The text of your prompt ("Please input a positive integer: ") and output strings
("Flux" and "Bunny") are stored in the processor's memory. After assembling your 
program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings are stored?
The static data (or simply data) segment of memory is the portion of memory starting
at address 0x10010000 and continuing until address 0x10040000.

What were the learning objectives of this lab?
It covered many MIPS commands, which included storing data in registers, putting labels
in approrpiate places, and branching or jumping to these labels properly. It also covered
how to cover our data in the .data area and our code in the .text area.  

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable? 
It was fun to start working with the MARS IDE. The lab offered quite a few challenges
and was indeed enjoyable. This was a very educational exercise.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?  
This was a perfect introduction to assembly language programming and the MARS IDE. It was
designed intelligently and I can't think of a way of improving it.
