These are the files that are included in this submission:
README (this file)
HelloUser.java
HelloUser2.java
Makefile
Hello (the jar file)

To compile the two Java source files, do this: 
make

To clean the binaries, do this:
make clean

The makefile creates a temporary manifest file that makes the main routine in HelloUser2.java take effect when you run the jar file Hello.

When you run Hello, you should see:
