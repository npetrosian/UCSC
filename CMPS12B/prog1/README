These are the files that are included in this submission:

Makefile
README (this file)
Recursion (the jar file)
Recursion.class (the compiled class file)
Recursion.java (the java source file)

To clean the binaries, do this:
make clean

To compile the Java source file, and create the .class and the jar file Recursion do this: 
make


The Makefile creates a temporary manifest file that makes the main routine in Recursion.java take effect when you run the jar file Recursion.

When you run Recursion, you should see:

-1 2 6 12 9 2 -5 -2 8 5 7 
minIndex = 6
maxIndex = 3
7 5 8 -2 -5 2 9 12 6 2 -1 
7 5 8 -2 -5 2 9 12 6 2 -1 
7 5 8 -2 -5 2 9 12 6 2 -1
