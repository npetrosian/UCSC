CMPS12B: Introduction to Data Structures

Teaches students to implement common data structures and the algorithms associated with each data structure, through 
progressively difficult exercises. Topics include big "O" notation; pointers, recursion (induction), and dynamic allocation; 
linked lists and list processing; stacks, queues, binary trees and binary search trees; simple sorting techniques and simple 
search techniques. Students will gain a working knowledge of the elements of the Java and C programming languages. 
Prior experience with Unix is assumed. Prerequisite(s): course 11 or 12A or Computer Engineering 13. Concurrent enrollment in 
course 12M required. (General Education Code(s): IN, MF - Mathematical and Formal Reasoning)
