CMPS5J: Introduction to Programming in Java

Introduces programming in Java for students who have no prior programming experience. Students learn programming and 
documentation skills, as well as algorithmic problem-solving, and programming methodologies. Introduces computers, compilers, 
and editors. Students write small to medium-sized programs. This course and courses 5C and 5P cover similar concepts, 
but use different programming languages. Because 5J followed by course 11 is a two-quarter alternative to the accelerated 
course 12A/L, engineering majors and students planning on continuing the programming sequence are encouraged to take 5J 
rather than 5C or 5P. Students may not receive credit for 5J taken concurrently or subsequently to course 12A, 12B, or 
Computer Engineering 13. (Formerly course 60G) (General Education Code(s): MF - Mathematical and Formal Reasoning)
